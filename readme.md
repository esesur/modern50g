# Modern HP 50g skin for the Emu48

Modern HP 50g calculator skin at 4x scale for mobile usage in mind.

Current aspect ratios are close to 16:9, 18:9 and 20:9. 

The size is off aspect ratio by a few pixels to maintain pixel-perfect buttons alignment and even margins, so you can use the "Fill Screen" layout mode to use the whole screen space if you want.

Text on some buttons has been shortened to keep visual consitency:\
NUM.SLV -> N.SLV\
FINANCE -> FINANC\
MATRICES -> MATR\
CONVERT -> CONV\
CMPLX -> CMPL

Used fonts:\
Roboto\
Roboto Condensed\
Roboto Mono
