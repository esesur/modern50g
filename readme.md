# Modern HP 50g skin for the Emu48

Modern HP 50g calculator skin at 4x scale for mobile usage in mind.

Current aspect ratios are close to 16:9 and 18:9. 

The height is off aspect ratio by a few pixels to maintain pixel-perfect buttons alignment and even margins, so you can use the "Fill Screen" layout mode to use the whole screen space if you want.
